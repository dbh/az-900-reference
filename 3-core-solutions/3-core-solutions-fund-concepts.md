# Core Solutions - Fundamental Concepts

## Cloud models
### Public
* No capital expenditures to scale up
* apps quickly provisioned and deprov
* pay for what you use


### Private
* Purchase HW for start up and maint
* complete control resources/sec
* responsible for hw maint / upg

### Hybrid
* most flex
* determine where to run apps
* control sec, compliance, legal req

## Cloud Advandages
* high availability (SLA)
* Scalability
* elasticity
* Agility
* Geo-distrib
* Disaster recovery
* Expenditure models
  * CapEx
    * up-front
    * phys infra
    * deduct over time
    * depreciated or amortized
  * OpEx
    * now
    * deduct in year spent
    * no up-front

## Models
### IaaS
* closest to managing phys servers
* ex 
  * VMs
  * data center
  * networking
  * servers and storage
  * provider provides
    * compute
    * networking
    * storage
### PaaS
* managed hosting env
* using VMs and network resources provided
* ex: 
  * Azure App Svcs
  * Operating Sys
  * Dev tools
  * bus analytics
  * provider (also) provides
    * VMs
    * OS
    * Runtime
### SaaS
* cloud provider handles all aspects of app env
* customer brings data
* ex: 
  * Office 365
  * hosted apps
* provider (also) provides
  * Applications
