# AI Services

AI - category of computing. adapt and improve decision making over time based on success/failures

Know about:
* Web API: Accessible from servers that accept requests via HTTP. (Also somewhat disagree. What about HTTPS. What about an HTTP interface on a private network?)
* Web API Endpoint : "Location of code library". (I disagree. That's a little vague and inaccurate)
* REST API: Dsign of URL style used to expose API's func

## Product options
